\problem{Ordering Tasks}

\noindent
UVa 10305\bigskip

John has $n$ tasks to do.
Unfortunately, the tasks are not independent and the execution of one task is only
possible if other tasks have already been executed. 


\subsection*{The Input}

The input will consist of several instances of
the problem. Each instance begins with a line containing two integers, $1\leq n\leq 100$ and $m$. $n$
is the number of tasks (numbered from 1
to $n$) and $m$ is the number of direct precedence relations between tasks. After
this, there will be $m$ lines with two
integers $i$ and $j$, representing the fact that task $i$ must be executed before task $j$.
An instance with $n = m = 0$ will
finish the input. 


\subsection*{The Output}

For each instance,
print a line with $n$ integers representing the tasks in a possible order of execution.
