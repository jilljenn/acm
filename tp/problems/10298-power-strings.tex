\problem{Power Strings}

\noindent
UVA 10298\bigskip

Given two strings $a$ and $b$ we define $a*b$ to be their concatenation. For example, if $a = "abc"$ and $b = "def"$ then $a*b = "abcdef"$. If we think of concatenation as multiplication, exponentiation by a non-negative integer is defined in the normal way: $a^0 = ""$ (the empty string) and $a^(n+1) = a*(a^n)$.
Each test case is a line of input representing $s$, a string of printable characters. For each $s$ you should print the largest $n$ such that $s = a^n$ for some string $a$. The length of $s$ will be at least 1 and will not exceed 1 million characters. A line containing a period follows the last test case.
